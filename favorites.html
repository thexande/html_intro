  <p>Alex's favorite animal is the llama. That's because he grew up with a pet llama named Bob. He used to take Bob everywhere with him. He would take him to the grocery store and they would go to baseball games together. Bob is actually the one who originally inspired Alex to take up coding. Alex has been working on an app to communicate with llamas for the last 10 years. He is almost there, he just needs to learn more about javascript promises.</p>
